# The-Effect-of-Term-Order-on-Identifying-Models-of-Gene-Regulatory-Networks

**Abstract:** Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) control many life processes. An important problem in systems biology is to identify a model of the network for a given set of laboratory data. A recently developed method builds a space of polynomial models from a given data set; however, it requires that an order on the variables (genes) and an order on the monomial terms (gene interactions) to be established. No rigorous analyses have been performed to determine the impact of these orders on the construction of the model space.
We chose a well-studied GRN in E. coli to study the effect of these orders on the identification of an existing model of the network. We also determined how much data, as well as which data explicitly are required for model identification.
